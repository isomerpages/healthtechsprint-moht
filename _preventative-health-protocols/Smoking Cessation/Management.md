## Referral resources

For patients in pre-contemplation/contemplation stage, GPs may wish to refer to PCN nurses for brief counselling support as needed. 

*Placeholder on the model of nursing support by PCNs, and support provided by Clusters to augment nursing manpower*

For patients who are prepared to quit (preparation stage), you may wish to encourage them to sign up for HPB I Quit, the national programme for smoking cessation, for counselling. *(insert URL or QR Code to HPB I Quit)*. For GPs on CMSes which are compatible with Healthier SG modules, you can receive regular updates on status of your patients who are enrolled in I Quit, and their quit outcomes via CMS. *Internal Note: IHIS has confirmed that the linkage between HPB IQuit and GP CMS is feasible by Day 1, provided HPB IQuit team submitted their requirements by 30 June*

You may also consider referral to other structured programmes for smoking cessation.
