# BACKGROUND
Smoking is a major risk factor, with 13.1% of deaths in Singapore attributed to smoking, both active and passive.

While a reduction in smoking results in lower mortality risk, **complete cessation** is much more beneficial.[1, 2, 3]

Target group: **all smokers**[4], especially patients with cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease (asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \[COPD\]), chronic kidney disease.

Target: **0 sticks per day**.
